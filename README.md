# SolLightning intermediary (TypeScript)

An off-chain app handling BTC <-> Solana cross-chain swaps, utilizing [SolLightning-program](https://github.com/adambor/SolLightning-program) Solana on-chain program.

Principle of operation is described in depth [here](https://github.com/adambor/SolLightning-readme/blob/main/sol-submarine-swaps.md) (for lightning network swaps) and [here](https://github.com/adambor/SolLightning-readme/blob/main/sol-onchain-swaps.md) (for bitcoin on-chain swaps)

This software is made to be used in conjunction with [client SDK](https://github.com/adambor/SolLightning-sdk).

**NOTE: This implementation is hardcoded to use bitcoin testnet3 and solana devnet, as it is still in alpha stage and is not safe to use for live systems. MAY contain bugs and uncovered edge-cases**

## REST API
This app starts an http rest api server on port 4000.

**NOTE:** Be sure to open this ports so client SDK can call the REST API.

## Requirements
* bitcoind node
* lnd node (Install instructions [here](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/blob/master/docs/INSTALL.md))
* nodejs (requires v18 or higher)
* npm
* typescript

## Installation
### Installing bitcoind
1. Download latest version from [here](https://bitcoincore.org/en/download/) or [build from source](https://baloian.medium.com/how-to-setup-and-run-a-bitcoin-full-node-on-ubuntu-a106fb86dbb3)
2. Use the configuration file [bitcoin.conf](https://github.com/adambor/SolLightning-Intermediary-TS/blob/main/bitcoind/bitcoin.conf)
3. Run the bitcoind with the configuration file: ```bitcoind -conf=<path/to/bitcoin.conf>```
4. Wait till bitcoind finishes with IBD (initial block download), should take no more than a few hours for testnet on a regular PC with good internet connection
5. Create a new wallet in bitcoind: ```bitcoin-cli -testnet -conf=<path/to/bitcoin.conf> createwallet test true false "" false false true false```
6. Set the configured rpc ip, port, username and password in _.env file (not necessary if you used provided [bitcoin.conf](https://github.com/adambor/SolLightning-Intermediary-TS/blob/main/bitcoind/bitcoin.conf))

### Installing lnd
1. Download latest version from [here](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/releases) or [build from source](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/blob/master/docs/INSTALL.md#installing-a-binary-release)
2. Use the provided configuration file [lnd.conf](https://github.com/adambor/SolLightning-Intermediary-TS/blob/main/lnd/lnd.conf)
3. Either place the lnd.conf file in ~/.lnd/ folder or run lnd with a --configfile argument: ```lnd --configfile=<path/to/lnd.conf>```
4. Wait for the lnd to startup. It should then ask you to create a wallet.
5. Create a new wallet with: ```lncli -n testnet create```
6. Save password you used to create a wallet to some known file (e.g. ~/lnd-pass.txt), and add ```wallet-unlock-password-file=<path/to/password-file>``` option to lnd.conf, like so:
    ```
    [Application Options]
    tlsextraip=127.0.0.1
    wallet-unlock-password-file=path/to/password-file
    ```
7. Get the certificate by  ```base64 --wrap=0 ~/.lnd/tls.cert``` and copy the output to LN_CERT field in _.env file
8. Get the admin macaroon by  ```base64 --wrap=0 ~/.lnd/data/chain/bitcoin/testnet/admin.macaroon``` and copy the output to LN_MACAROON field in _.env file
9. Set the ip and port in the _.env (not needed if using provided [lnd.conf](https://github.com/adambor/SolLightning-Intermediary-TS/blob/main/lnd/lnd.conf))
10. Get the bitcoin address ```lncli -n testnet newaddress p2wkh```
11. Get some testnet bitcoin to that address through one of the faucets:
    * [coinfaucet.eu](https://coinfaucet.eu/en/btc-testnet)
    * [bitcoinfaucet.uo1.net](https://bitcoinfaucet.uo1.net/)
    * [testnet-faucet.com](https://testnet-faucet.com/btc-testnet/)
    * [onchain.io](https://onchain.io/bitcoin-testnet-faucet)
12. Connect to a well connected bitcoin lightning node, you can find the list [here](https://1ml.com/testnet/node?order=capacity). Pick a node and copy its connection string (should look like so: 038863cf8ab91046230f561cd5b386cbff8309fa02e3f0c3ed161a3aeb64a643b9@203.132.94.196:9735). Then use ```lncli -n testnet connect <connection string>``` to connect to that node.
13. Open a channel with the node you connected to. Take the public key from the connection string (the part before '@', e.g.: 038863cf8ab91046230f561cd5b386cbff8309fa02e3f0c3ed161a3aeb64a643b9). Open a channel with ```lncli -n testnet openchannel <node public key> <amount> <push_amount>```. Be sure to push half of your channel's balance to the other node so you can receive, e.g. ```lncli -n testnet openchannel <node public key> 100000 50000```
14. Wait for the channel to be established, you can monitor pending channels with: ```lncli -n testnet pendingchannels```

### Installing btcrelay
Instructions available [here](https://github.com/adambor/BTCRelay-Sol-Offchain). Skip steps 2.-4. as you already have bitcoind setup and running.

### Installing sollightning
1. Install necessary npm packages: ```npm install```
2. Install typescript: ```npm install -g typescript```
3. Compile to javascript: ```tsc```
4. Rename _.env file to .env
5. Generate a new solana keypair: ```npm run genKey```
6. Airdrop some devnet tokens to your newly generated solana wallet: ```npm run airdrop```
7. Create the WBTC, USDC and USDT tokens on devnet: ```npm run createToken```
8. Mint some WBTC/USDC/USDT token to your new keypair: ```npm run mint <WBTC/USDC/USDT> <amount to mint in satoshis>```
9. You can also mint some WBTC/USDC/USDT tokens to your phantom wallet: ```npm run mint <WBTC/USDC/USDT> <amount to mint in satoshis> <wallet address>```
10. Deposit your WBTC/USDC/USDT to the program ```npm run deposit <WBTC/USDC/USDT> <amount to deposit in satoshis>```
11. Be sure that bitcoind, lnd and btcrelay are running before starting the app.
12. Run the app with: ```npm start```
